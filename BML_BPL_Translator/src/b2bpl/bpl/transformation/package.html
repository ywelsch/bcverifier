Contains classes related to the transformation of a BoogiePL program on an
abstract syntax tree level.

<p>
Every class which would like to contribute to the set of transformations
performed on the BoogiePL program resulting from the core translation of
bytecode classes to BoogiePL should implement the
{@link b2bpl.bpl.transformation.BPLTransformator} interface. Every such
transformator registered to the actual translation process is then able to
perform an arbitrary set of transformations on the current version of the
BoogiePL program being processed.
