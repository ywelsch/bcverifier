BCVerifier -- Verifying backward compatibility for Java packages
==============

A library implementation is backward compatible with an older version if the new implementation of the library preserves the behavior of the old implementation for all programs in which the old implementation was used.
BCVerifier is a tool that allows to automatically check backward compatibility between two Java library implementations.

More documentation will be made available soon.
