Contains classes related to the analysis of Java bytecode.

<p>
Most classes are related to the flow analysis of bytecode methods:
<ul>
  <li>
    The {@link b2bpl.bytecode.analysis.ControlFlowGraph ControlFlowGraph} class
    provides a simple implementation of a control flow graph whose vertices and
    edges are represented by the {@link b2bpl.bytecode.analysis.BasicBlock
    BasicBlock} and {@link b2bpl.bytecode.analysis.Edge Edge} classes,
    respectively. In addition, the {@code ControlFlowGraph} class also embodies
    a set of loop analysis algorithms. The actual construction of a
    {@code ControlFlowGraph} for a given bytecode method is performed by the
    {@link b2bpl.bytecode.analysis.CFGBuilder CFGBuilder} class.
  </li>
  <li>
    The {@link b2bpl.bytecode.analysis.FlowAnalyzer FlowAnalyzer} class performs
    a dataflow analysis on a given bytecode method and is based on the analysis
    framework of the ASM bytecode library. The flow analysis results in the
    computation of the {@link b2bpl.bytecode.analysis.StackFrame StackFrame}s
    at the individual bytecode instructions.
  </li>
</ul>
In addition, a {@link b2bpl.bytecode.analysis.SemanticAnalyzer SemanticAnalyzer}
is provided which performs a semantic analysis on a whole bytecode class
including BML specifications.
