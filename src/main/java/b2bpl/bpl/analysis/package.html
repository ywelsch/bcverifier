Contains classes related to the analysis of a BoogiePL program.

<p>
In particular, a set of classes for the flow analysis of BoogiePL programs
are provided, such as classes for representing and constructing the control
flow graph of a BoogiePL procedure implementation. In addition, different loop
analysis algorithms are provided either directly by the control flow graph
implementation or else by specialized classes which, for example, allow to
compute the set of loop targets for a given loop header.
